## What is OWASP ? 

- OWASP Top 10 is a list of the 10 most critical security risks for web applications, published by the OWASP (`Open Web Application Security Project`) community. 
- It’s like a security awareness guide for developers, testers, and security professionals.



## OWASP Top Ten Security Risks (2021)

- Broken Access Control :

    - Users can access data or actions they shouldn’t (eg- normal user accessing admin page).

- Cryptographic Failures (Sensitive Data Exposure) :

    - Improper handling of sensitive data (passwords, credit cards) due to weak or no encryption.

- Injection :

    - Malicious data injected into queries (SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection, LDAP Injection).

- Insecure Design :

    - Poor application design decisions (lack of threat modeling, insecure workflows).

- Security Misconfiguration :

    - Default passwords, unnecessary features enabled, open cloud storage, misconfigured security headers.

- Vulnerable and Outdated Components :

    - Using old frameworks, libraries, or software with known vulnerabilities.

- Identification and Authentication Failures :

    - Weak authentication, poor session handling, credential stuffing, brute force attacks.

- Software and Data Integrity Failures :

    - Untrusted software updates, insecure CI/CD pipelines, reliance on plugins without verification.

- Security Logging and Monitoring Failures :

    - Missing logs, poor alerting, slow incident response.

- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) :

    - Attacker tricks the server into making unauthorized requests (e.g., fetching internal resources).


## What is CSRF ?
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a web security vulnerability where an attacker tricks a logged-in user’s browser into sending unauthorized requests to a trusted web application.

- It’s like forcing someone to perform an action without their consent while they’re already logged in.

## CSRF token :
- Secret random key generated by server, sent with client request, and validated by server to ensure the request is genuine.

## What is DAO ?
- It’s a design pattern used to separate the data access logic (like database queries) from the business logic of the application.

- DAO acts like a middle layer between your application and the database.

- It provides methods for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

- This way, you don’t scatter SQL queries all over your code.
